# Production Database Reseed Guide

This guide explains how to safely wipe and reseed the production database with fresh data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**This operation will DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA in the production database!**

- Make sure you have backups if needed
- This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone
- Only run this on production when you're certain you want to replace all data

## Prerequisites

1. **Database Access**: Ensure you have access to the production database
2. **Environment Variables**: Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

## Method 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

### Quick Reseed
```bash
# Set your production database URL
export DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"

# Run the automated script
./scripts/reseed-production.sh
```

### What the script does:
1. ‚úÖ Checks prerequisites
2. ‚úÖ Confirms the operation with user
3. ‚úÖ Cleans existing data (force reset)
4. ‚úÖ Runs the comprehensive seed script
5. ‚úÖ Verifies the results
6. ‚úÖ Reports success/failure

## Method 2: Manual Steps

If you prefer to run the steps manually:

### Step 1: Clean Database
```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

### Step 2: Run Seed Script
```bash
npx ts-node src/seed.ts
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
```bash
# Check user count
npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM \"User\";"

# Check event count  
npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM \"Event\";"
```

## What Gets Created

The seed script creates:

### üë§ Users
- **1 Admin user**: `admin@linea.app`
- **5 Owner users**: Complete business profiles with contact info
- **100 Visitor users**: Realistic names and email addresses

### üè¢ Business Data
- **5 Categories**: Design, Fashion, Furniture, Textiles, Technology
- **5 Areas**: Brera, Navigli, Garibaldi, Porta Nuova, Quadrilatero
- **5 Products**: Furniture, Fashion, Textiles, Technology, Design
- **5 Venues**: Complete venue information with addresses

### üéâ Events
- **5 Comprehensive events**: Full event details with:
  - Complete metadata (features, awards, social links)
  - Contact information
  - QR codes (auto-generated)
  - Waitlist entries
  - Proper associations with owners

### üìç Location Data
- All events have proper addresses
- Google Maps integration ready
- Latitude/longitude coordinates

## Verification Checklist

After reseeding, verify:

- [ ] Admin can log in at `/admin`
- [ ] Owners can log in at `/owner` 
- [ ] Events are visible on homepage
- [ ] Event pages load correctly
- [ ] Maps show event locations
- [ ] QR codes are generated
- [ ] Waitlist functionality works
- [ ] Nearby events are shown

## Troubleshooting

### If the script fails:

1. **Check database connection**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

2. **Check seed script**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   npx ts-node src/seed.ts
   ```

3. **Manual verification**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

### Common Issues:

- **Permission errors**: Ensure database user has full access
- **Connection timeouts**: Check network connectivity
- **Schema errors**: Run `npx prisma db push` first
- **Seed script errors**: Check console output for specific errors

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Restore from backup** (if available)
2. **Manual database reset**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push --force-reset
   ```
3. **Re-run seed script**:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node src/seed.ts
   ```

## Security Notes

- Never commit production database URLs to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider using a staging environment first
- Always backup before major operations

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify your database connection
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check the Prisma schema is up to date

**Remember**: This is a destructive operation. Only proceed if you're certain you want to replace all production data.
