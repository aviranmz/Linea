Part 1 — Night in Milan, cinematic city glow reflects on wet cobblestones; ambient electro plays softly; camera drifts past elegant facades, then tilts down into a phone screen that feels alive. The Linea home UI breathes with subtle micro-animations: curated events appear as glossy cards with cover photos, crisp typography, and clean iconography. As the thumb scrolls, dates, neighborhoods, and tags slide into view with gentle parallax; a tap opens an event—hero image expands, details unfurl: start time, venue map snippet, dress code, languages supported, and a visible attendee vibe score. The camera contrasts moody streetlight with the app’s luminous clarity, signaling trust and taste. Copy overlays whisper: “Discover what’s next, not what’s noisy.” The scroll pauses on a call-to-action button: “Get Access.” The finger hovers; a subtle pulse invites action. As the button is pressed, the UI morphs into an elevated state and the frame holds for a beat, inviting us to step behind the scenes. Transition to Part 2 — reveal how owners create the magic.
Part 2 — The phone rotates to landscape and the Owner Portal materializes: polished, professional, effortless. VO: “Linea makes hosting feel as curated as attending.” Owner (soft, focused): “New event… title: Aperitivo & Vinyl. Starts eight. Capacity: one-twenty.” Inputs respond with tactile haptics. VO: “Smart defaults remember what works—neighborhood, languages, door policy.” The owner drags photos; the gallery snaps into a clean mosaic. Owner: “Looks right. Preview.” A live preview animates in, matching the guest view exactly. VO: “Quality is built in—clear categories, VIP tiers, accurate maps.” Guestlist tools slide open: import contacts, add notes, assign roles. Owner: “Private link for partners; open waitlist early.” VO: “Interest updates in real time—reach, saves, projected conversion.” Tiny counters tick up as early RSVPs arrive; a compact insights panel stays legible and calm. Owner: “Go live.” The button glows, syncs to cloud; a soft chime confirms. VO: “Published.” A ripple spreads across the interface, pulling us forward. Transition to Part 3 — experience entry, access, and flow at the door.
Part 3 — Evening rush at the venue door: warm light, quick movement, friendly staff. A phone in staff mode displays Linea’s access tools: QR codes glow with subtle depth, scanning is near-instant with forgiving angles and motion blur compensation. Allowed, paused, or flagged states are legible at a glance, with haptics and clear color. A guest arrives early; the system politely offers timed hold. Another walks up without a ticket—staff taps “Join waitlist,” sets priority conditions, and Linea auto-sorts as capacity changes, notifying the next eligible guest with a reassuring tone. Edge cases feel designed: network dip triggers offline cache with later sync; ID verification flows only when required; multi-language prompts help visiting guests. A small banner shows live capacity, average dwell time, and door throughput. The line moves smoothly, drama-free. Guest smiles, wristband applied, entry logged, profile enriched with consent. A tiny navigation hint surfaces: “Explore nearby after the show.” The camera lifts above the crowd, the city map sparkles below. Transition to Part 4 — discover the city with context-aware maps and language.
Part 4 — The interactive map breathes: Milan neighborhoods pulse subtly; points of interest light up around the event’s venue, tuned to time-of-night and guest preferences. Filters glide into focus—music styles, ambience, budget, open-now—each switch updates results with kinetic clarity. A bilingual toggle flips smoothly; all labels and UI adapt without breaking layout, reflecting Linea’s commitment to inclusive experiences. Tap a venue card: dynamic previews show photos, peak hours, and crowd vibe; deep links return to events or to owner profiles. A soft path animates a suggested walk between hotspots; transit alternatives fade in for late-night options. The map zooms out, revealing a constellation of upcoming events and saved places, traced like threads in a personal city tapestry. A discreet footer notes the current build version for trust and transparency. The Linea logo resolves as a luminous mark; the tagline lands: “Curate your night.” The camera settles on a single inviting button: “Start with Linea.” End — the four-part flow completes as one continuous journey.
Part 5 — A lady faces camera, Milan night behind her, voice warm and assured. Lady: “Linea is your trusted guide to the city’s real culture—curated events, effortless access, and tools that respect your time.” Lady: “Whether you’re hosting or exploring, we make every night feel intentional, safe, and beautifully simple.”
